This repository contains two Python scripts designed for quantitative analysis of Super-Resolution Microscopy (SMLM) data, particularly those generated by DNA-PAINT and processed using tools like Picasso (Jungmann Group).
The analyses cover molecular clustering (NND vs. CSR) and localization precision (Cluster vs. RESI).
1. Nearest-Neighbor Distance (NND) Analysis Script
The first script (Compare_expnnd_simCSR.py) performs a spatial clustering analysis by comparing experimental nearest-neighbor distances (NND) to distances expected under conditions of Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR).

Key Features
•	Input: Reads experimental NND data from a CSV file.
•	CSR Simulation: Generates a set of random coordinates (CSR) matched to the experimental cluster density (C/A), where C is the number of clusters and A is the ROI area.
•	NND Calculation: Uses scipy.spatial.KDTree to efficiently calculate the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd nearest-neighbor distances for the simulated CSR data.
•	Visualization: Plots the distribution (histogram) of the experimental NND values against the simulated CSR NND values for direct comparison.
•	Output: Saves the comparison plot (compare_CSR_NND.png) and the calculated CSR NND data (compare_CSR_NND.csv).

Configuration (config.ini - NND Section)
Section	Parameter	Description
[INPUT_FILES]	path	Path to the folder containing the input CSV and for saving results.
[INPUT_FILES]	NND_file_name	Name of the CSV file containing the experimental NND data.
[PARAMETERS]	cluster	Total number of clusters identified (integer).
[PARAMETERS]	area_ROI	Area of the Region of Interest (ROI) used for imaging, in µm2 (integer).

3. RESI Resolution Analysis Script
The second script (Plot_RESI_resolution.py) evaluates the resolution achievable within molecular clusters (e.g. SMLM or DBSCAN) compared to the corresponding RESI localization precision.

Key Features
•	Input: Loads cluster localization data (SMLM) and corresponding single-localization precision data (RESI) from HDF5 files.
•	Recenter & Rescale: Recalculates all localizations relative to the center of mass for each cluster, setting the effective center to (0,0). Converts coordinates from raw units to nanometers (nm).
•	Resolution Comparison: Calculates the experimental σCluster from the spread of re-centered localizations and compares it to the mean theoretical σRESI.
•	Visualization: Generates a two-panel plot:
o	Scatter Plot: Shows the physical spread of localizations with a circle indicating the σRESI.
o	Distribution Plot: Overlays the Gaussian fit for the measured cluster spread (σCluster) and the RESI reference precision (σRESI) to visualize the difference between measured structure and theoretical resolution limit.

Configuration (config.ini - RESI Section)
Section	Parameter	Description
[INPUT_FILES]	path	Path to the folder containing the input HDF5 files and for saving results.
[INPUT_FILES]	RESI_file_name	Name of the HDF5 file containing the RESI localization precision data (e.g., 'lpx' column).
[INPUT_FILES]	SMLM_cluster_name	Name of the HDF5 file containing the grouped SMLM localization data.
